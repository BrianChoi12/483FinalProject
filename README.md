The combined datasets we generated can be accessed at this link with a Yale University login: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KaSgvtvzCpB9FM7De4F1TciyhfkC-A1z?usp=sharing

Then, the train.ipynb notebook can be run on google colab if the aforementioned dataset is downloaded to the local Google Drive. Our full training loop requires access to A100 gpus using Google Colab credits.
